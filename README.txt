Master Cipher

The Master Cipher software possesses  a unique algorithm based on the above symmetric key algorithms. This unique algorithm designed by me is very difficult to exploit using a brute-force attack because of its very complex logic and combination of different algorithms mixed together to develop a strong and an almost unbreakable encryption of a plain text.

The software as a whole is of a very small size and has a very easy and basic user interface which makes it very very simple and easy to use. A plain text can be encrypted in many different ways to produce a different encryption each time. As a whole user will be able to carry out the encryption and decryption mechanism without hassle.
